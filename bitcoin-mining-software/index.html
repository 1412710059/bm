<p>While the actual process of Bitcoin mining is handled by the Bitcoin mining hardware itself, special Bitcoin mining software is needed to connect your Bitcoin miners to the blockchain and your Bitcoin mining pool as well, if you are part of a Bitcoin mining pool.
<p>The software delivers the work to the miners and receives the completed work from the miners and relays that information back to the blockchain and your mining pool. The best Bitcoin mining software can run on almost any operating system, such as OSX, Windows, Linux, and has even been ported to work on a Raspberry Pi with some modifications for drivers depending on your mining setup.
<p>Not only does the Bitcoin mining software relay the input and output of your Bitcoin miners to the blockchain, but it also monitors them and displays general statistics such as the temperature, hashrate, fan speed, and average speed of the Bitcoin miner.
<p>There are a few different types of Bitcoin mining software out there and each have their own advantages and disadvantages, so be sure to read up on the various mining software out there.
<h2>Network Consensus</h2>
<p>If you solo-mine, meaning you do not mine with a Bitcoin mining pool, then you will need to ensure that you are in consensus with the Bitcoin network. The best way is to use the <a href="http://bitcoin.org/en/download">official BitCore client</a>.
<p>If you participate in a Bitcoin mining pool then you will want to ensure that they are engaging in behavior that is in agreement with your philosophy towards Bitcoin.
<p>For example, some rogue developers have threatened to release software that could hard-fork the network which would likely result in tremendous financial damage.
<p>Therefore, it is your duty to make sure that any Bitcoin mining power you direct to a mining pool does not attempt to enforce network consensus rules you disagree with.
<h2>Bitcoin Wallet Software</h2>
<p>The whole point of mining bitcoins is to earn them!
<p>Sure, Bitcoin mining is difficult to do profitably but if you try then this <a href="http://www.runtogold.com/bitcoinminer">Bitcoin miner</a> is probably a good shot.
<p>But once you earn them then where do you keep them safe and secure? For a Bitcoin wallet we <b>highly recommend</b> using one where you hold your own private keys in contrast to to a hosted wallet like Coinbase or Circle.

<h2><em>Examples of the best Bitcoin mining software for Windows, Linux and Mac OSX:</em></h2>
<p><strong><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/minepeon/">MINE PEON</a>:</strong> Open source and may need <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">WinDisk32Imager</a>.
<p><strong>EASYMINER:</strong> A GUI based miner for Windows, Linux and Android.  EasyMiner acts as a convenient wrapper for the built in CG; BFGminer softwares.  It auto configures your Bitcoin miners and provides performance graphs to for easy visualization of your Bitcoin mining activity.
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/luke-jr/bfgminer">BFGMINER</a>:</strong> A modular ASIC, FPGA, GPU and CPU miner written in C, cross platform for Linux, Mac, and Windows including support for OpenWrt-capable routers.
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer">CGMINER</a>:</strong> This is a multi-threaded multi-pool GPU, FPGA and ASIC miner with ATI GPU monitoring, (over)clocking and fanspeed support for bitcoin and derivative coins.
<p><em>If you want to get a better idea of mining without installing any Bitcoin mining software then try Bitcoin Plus, a browser-based CPU Bitcoin miner. As a CPU miner it's not cost-efficient for serious Bitcoin mining but it helps illustrate the process of Bitcoin pool mining.</em>
