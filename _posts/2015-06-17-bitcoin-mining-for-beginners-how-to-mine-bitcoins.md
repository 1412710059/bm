<p>All right.  So I'm going to walk you through how to start mining Dogecoin.  The first thing you need to do is join a pool and right now I'm using poolerino.  It's the most popular one.  There's tons you can find online that doesn't really matter.  The first thing you need to do is click a sign up button.  That will take you to this page where you can register account. There's a number of fields you have to fill out.
<p>I'm not going to do it for you because I already have an account.  So I'm just going to go in menu, login.  All right.  So this is what the inside of the mining pool website looks like.  The only thing you really need to do to here to get started is create a new worker.  You can do that clicking the My Workers thing.  You'll see I've got a couple of workers here.  You can add a new worker with this tab on the side.  I'm going to make another one.  Just call it something worker 2.  And when you add that worker, you'll see that it successfully gets added and you now have a new worker.  So it's pretty much all we need to worry about here.  And there are few things you need to remember when you get to later steps.
<p>The first is your username, which in my case is Ardo.  Also, your worker name, which is worker 2 and your worker password, which in this case is also worker 2.  We're going to use these later.  The only other thing you need to know is the host name, which you can find out at this home tab.  If you scroll all the way to the bottom in that homepage you'll see it's in this comment. But you want this, you should probably go ahead and copy that and we'll use that later.  All right.  So the next thing you need to do is download the actual software to do the mining that available at SourceForge, and it's called CPU miner. Go ahead and download that. The link's in the description.  It will start your download and while this is going, let's go over to finder, check out our Downloads folder.  You'll see that it's a zip file, so you're going to need to expand that.  So go ahead and double-click that, it will expand, you'll see this minerd executable, which is basically the program that we're going to run to mine.
<p>Now to run this, we need to use an application called Terminal.  You can find that in your applications folder under Utilities.  It should be all the way at the bottom here, yep, double click it.  You'll open up a Terminal, it looks like this.  If you're not comfortable with it that's fine, I'm going tell you exactly what's you need to type to get this running, then you start with cd downloads, which is going to take you into the Downloads folder, basically, which is where that minerd file is.
<p>You then need to change the permissions on minerd.  So you type chmod 755 minerd, which is going to allow you to run the file.  And then you're ready to run it, you need to dot, slash, minerd.  The first thing you need is dash O and then you paste that host name that you copied earlier.  And then the only other thing you need is user pass, dash, dash, userpass and you need to set that equal to their user name, which in my case was Ardo, dot, your worker name, which was worker 2 for me and then a colon and your worker password, which was also worker 2.
<p>And then you hit enter and your program is running, you're now mining with your CPU.  Right.  So I just fast forward about twenty minutes.  It's been running for twenty minutes now.  You'll see it's still going that the hash rate is a little bit higher.  More importantly, you see these accepted messages which means that you are generating valid Dogecoins.
If you zoom out and you go back to that pool website and refresh it, you can confirm that it's working there, as well.  This might take a little bit.  But when you go back, you'll see hash rate on your dashboard as well as a number of valid coins that you've produced.  There you have it.
