<p>USB <a href="/what-is-dogecoin-mining/">Bitcoin miners are available to buy</a>, but they don’t really generate any significant profits. You should buy one to learn how mining works, but other than that don’t expect much! If you are serious about making profit then check out better Bitcoin mining hardware.</p>

<p>If you want bitcoins don't bother trying with a USB miner. You are better off buying bitcoins.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin USB Miners Comparison</h2>

<p><h2>ASICMiner Block Erupter USB 330MH/s Sapphire Miner</h2></p>


<p>The Sapphire Block Erupters were the first Bitcoin USB miners. They have 330 MH/s of hash power which would net you less than $0.01 per month. It may be a good choice just to see how mining works, but like with most USB miners: do not expect to turn a profit.</p>

<p><h2>GekkoScience Compac USB Stick Bitcoin Miner</h2></p>


<p>The GekkoScience miners is just slightly better than the <a href="/what-is-litecoin-mining/">original block erupters</a>. It will net you about $0.15 per month, which is more than a dollar per year! The company claims that the device runs completely silent. It works with just one USB port.</p>

<h2>Avalon Nano 3</h2>


<p>The Avalon Nano 3 is a 3.6 GH/s miner, which will earn you about $1 per year. No fan is required and it just plugs into your USB port on any computer.</p>

<h2>Bitmain Antrouter R1 Wifi Solo Bitcoin Miner</h2>


<p><a href="/bitcoin-mining-for-beginners-how-to-mine-bitcoins/">The Bitmain AntRouter</a> isn't exactly a USB miner, but it is similar. It's low cost, but with that you get a low GH/s at just 5.5 GH/s which is a little over $1 per year. </p>

<p>The plus side is it works as a wireless router, so you can do some mining while providing internet for all your devices.</p>

<h2>21 Bitcoin Computer</h2>


<p>The 21 Bitcoin Computer isn't the typical USB Bitcoin miner. It does, however, plugin to your computer via USB. In terms of $ / hash rate, it's not a very good choice. But since it's still technically a USB miner we have included it in this list.</p>

<p>If you’re not impressed, we don’t blame you! USB Bitcoin mining was only profitable when Bitcoin was in its early years. If you just want bitcoins then invest in <a href="/what-is-bitcoin-mining-difficulty/">serious mining hardware</a> or just buy bitcoins.</p>
